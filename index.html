            <p>Nice to meet you! I'm Cinnamon, an 18 year old aspiring front-end web developer. I live in Pflugerville, but I was born in California and raised in central Ohio. I plan on moving back to California in February though!</p>

            <p>I embroider, bake, and play video games in my free time, but I'm usually at work since I currently work full-time in food service. :( I make damn good banana bread though!</p>
            <p>I'm engaged to my wonderful boyfriend Todd, we started dating on December 20th of 2017 and got engaged on April 14th of this year! When I can save up the money, I'm going to move in with him and finally marry him. â™¡ He's honestly the love of my life, and chances are, if you talk to me, I'll end up talking about him one way or another, LOL.</p>
